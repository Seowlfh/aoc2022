# aoc2022

Repository for my 2022 run of the [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com). I did not manage to go very far in the previous iterations of the event, so I'm hoping I can go a little bit further now~

I'll be doing this one in [Haskell](haskell.org), to learn more about the functional paradygm. Also because it looks fun.
